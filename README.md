# Python Apprenticeship Repository

## Introduction

This repository documents my Python apprenticeship, showcasing my progress and projects. Each day of my apprenticeship is dedicated to learning and implementing new concepts and skills in Python.

## Days Filled

1. Day 7 - Hangman
2. Day 8 - Functions
3. Day 9 - Dictionaries
4. Day 10 - Calculator

## Project Details

### Day 7 - Hangman

In this project, I implemented a Hangman game using Python. The game allows users to guess letters to uncover a hidden word within a specified number of attempts.

### Day 8 - Functions

During Day 8, I focused on learning about functions in Python. I explored the concept of reusable code blocks and how to define, call, and pass arguments to functions.

### Day 9 - Dictionaries

Day 9 was dedicated to understanding dictionaries in Python. I learned how to store and manipulate key-value pairs, allowing efficient data retrieval and modification.

### Day 10 - Calculator

For Day 10, I developed a calculator program using Python. This calculator provides basic arithmetic operations and allows users to perform calculations with ease.
